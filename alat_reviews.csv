Ugochi Joy,1,This app can't offer loan. I've provided all my details. But still stating an error occurred while trying to validate bvn. However my bvn was linked via the ussd code. So what's the essence of advertising that you offer loan effortlessly when it's a lie. Since two days now trying to validate bvn. Same bvn that has been linked via ussd. You people should stop saying what u can't offer and stop adding more stress to people who are going through a lot. It's a zero for the rating,2025-04-28 08:28:01,1

But there's a bit of an issue I started noticing on the app, it's frequently crashes, even when I want to login, it now crashes for the first time, then it becomes okay on my second login trial, please the developer should thoroughly go through through it, see the faults and have fix on it, even to some extent it even crashes when you navigate to the loan options. Please to fix the issue here,I think that's all for nowThanks,",2024-08-03 18:43:54,13
vivian umeozulu,4,The app's interface is only fine with some of the prompts either slow / malfunctioning. Initial app reg. was very hectic and took days after presenting at the bank. Acc. that was solely opened as a Salary based account and used up to 11 months is not recognized as one. Software is to be blamed even with the evidences boldly stored in it. NIN reg is also unsuccessful. Transactions take a lot of time to process sometimes. Issues on account type benefits and app slowness rectified. Rating increased,2024-08-02 13:29:00,10

I tracked the said from the app. I was surprised when the app said delivered. Whereas it's yet to be delivered to till tomorrow. I have complained but to no avail. It's so disappointing. In your next update please insert branches where one can select for easy collection of his / her card. Banks like Access have such.

John Mikky,1,This is the worst online banking app. My account has been restricted since last week despite providing all required details same as many other users. You can verify yourself. I have sent mails and called but the same story all the time and apologies as always.Others might be having good experience but you are better off using other online banking apps. ALAT has an inefficient verification platform. You will thank me later. Good luck,2023-03-02 08:18:25,9

Michael Musa,1,I have a big problem with repeat transactions being allowed by the application. If you instantly repeat a transaction that seems not to have gone through the app should block the repeat and only allow same transaction to be repeated only after a certain time threshold. I once had a dstv subscription that seemed not to have gone through only to have the transaction repeated when I tried it again meaning I paid double when I did not plan to. And also ALAT support ignored all my complaints.,2022-02-12 12:10:31,2

Stephen Oduneye,1,I don't know what is wrong with Wemaüò†üò†. I open this Wema account because I was going to school and I have no other option than to open this bank. Somebody sent me money today and Wema deducted 200 for nothing. It is either you are going on maintenance today or the server is down. The best thing is to open a better bank account or just open Kuda. Plz fix all this issues,2021-10-28 18:10:48,0

In fact, they even debited me N50 for Transfer Levy then froze my account. The monies belong to an NGO and meant to carry out an activity for the Independence Day Celebration. I rushed to the bank and complained. After checking my account. They said that it required upgrade. I submitted all my documents but they said they needed the people managing the app to resolve the issue. The bank sent a mail to them. In their response, they kept instructing that my information be updated vide the app. I tried to update the app so many times but no way. You cannot edit anything on app. I sent a mail explaining the difficulty but I got the same response. These people just want me to lose my job but I know that I won't go down alone for this.

Once you paste the account number and click the bank next you'll be getting retry error when trying to load account details. So to get a successful transfer (1) select the name of the recipient bank first and then after selecting the bank (2) you paste the account number of the recipient it'll load the name of the account owner successfully,2021-09-02 14:56:42,9

Jon Doe,1,To say that this app is messed up would be the biggest understatement of 2020.

After more than a month the app still tells me that the photos have not been verified. So what was the point??? For weeks I have been sending mails with no response.

A Google user,2,ALAT Loan is scam. You can not get loan until you do a saving of some money. You must have money in your account before any loan is possible. Let's say you have 100k on your ALAT Account. For you to get loan of 80k you must do a saving of 100k. After the goal saving is completed. ALAT Will not release your complete money until you pay the loan. What's the point? Rubbish!!!,2018-09-25 20:17:18,2

Of all the promises given, they sure lack the tech and  mentality to actualize them.   I sent them mesage on Facebook to tell them about why the 2 days their system promised that the verification and upgrade of my account would take hasn't come since 23rd of January despite uploading every documents all in clear version and the address tallying with every documents uploaded, but they still have my account stuck at 90% with, but their page got blocked me from messaging them ever again.    A friend still has his account upgrade ongoing since 4 months already, why the hell would a company be promising what they can't deliver?   The physical card still hasn't been delivered. I think the old school banking is perfect enough compared to this crappy system filled with unfulfillable promises..",2018-04-06 16:19:10,0
A Google user,4,"The ALAT banking platform is pretty much all round awesome. The interface is beautiful and functional, the functions are easy to find, easy to use. The level of control and information you get over your money is next to none and there are so many unique helper functions that are extremely useful. That said, there are some kinks that need to be worked out, like the account upgrade. Not very impressive currently. I'd also like to see a flexible stash.

A Google user,5,"There is something i love about ALAT, when it comes to bills payment No banking app can match ALAT, this is the reason i said so, (1) whenever you want to make a bill payment it will show you if the machant is available or not by displaying your card or meter name. (2) if u still go ahead and make the payment when the machant is not available or there is a network problem or the transaction failed. It will refund your money to your account immediately. I use more than 15 banking apps & none of them does is bill payments like ALAT. I have lost alot of money on other apps on bills payments. Imagine when u try to make a bill payment of #1,000 and the transaction failed and you where debited, then u try calling the bank with almost #500 credit for a revarsal. Then what's the need of using that kind of a medium next time? U maybe lucky for some banks that makes automatic revarsal in 24hours. But only ALAT reverse it immediately.",2017-09-19 13:13:59,25

They should own the product.",2017-06-22 17:09:20,13
